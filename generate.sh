# this script is run by https://github.com/DDNetPP/maps-zillyhuhn.com
# and the generated map will also be committed automatically

# ideally scripts are based on the original map
# like for example fokkonaut's dark mode of BlmapChill
# https://github.com/DDNetPP/maps-scripts/tree/master/BlmapChill/themes
# this generate.sh covers the custom scripts that are applied on top of designs

# like for example chillber_dark which is considered a BlmapChill theme but is applied to chillber

# python3 ./scripts/chillber_dark.py ./BlmapChill/chillber.map ./BlmapChill/chillber_dark.map
